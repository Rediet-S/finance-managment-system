      <p><em><strong><u>The Knowledge Pool</u></strong></em></p>
      <p align="justify"><em>Haramaya   University is one of the most prominent and prestigious universities in   Ethiopia. The University, in its fifty eight years of establishment,   has educated a number of individuals who have contributed to the   improvement and development of the world.&nbsp; A good recent example is </em>Professor Gebisa Ejeta, who <em>has received the World</em> <em>Food Prize, an honour that is considered by many to be the Nobel</em> <em>Prize   of agriculture. The University has been the knowledge pool for many   other intellectuals, who have made their mission helping human kind and   improving our earth. </em></p>
      <p><em><strong><u>Historical Background</u></strong></em></p>
      <p align="justify"><em>Haramaya   University, formerly known as Alemaya University, was established with   the initiative of Emperor Haile Selassie in 1954 based on the need for   modernizing Ethiopian agriculture in particular and education in general   through the establishment of an agricultural college and training. It   was based on the emperor&rsquo;s wish that the college is founded at its   current location. Up until 1963, Oklahoma State University was given the   mandate to establish and operate the college. In the past few years the   university has witnessed tremendous expansion in terms of fields of   study and facilities.</em></p>
